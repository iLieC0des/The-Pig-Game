# The-Pig-Game
Hi Lucas here, and here's another project that I've worked on, and here I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
During the game of Pig, two players will attempt to reach 100 points by rolling dice repeatedly until they reach a 1,
or they will hold the die and score the sum of their dice rolls (i.e. the turn total).
At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:

                ------------------------------X------------------------------
                --------------* Roll * - If the player rolls a --------------
               1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.
        2 to 6: The number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
     * Hold * - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
                 Here, you have to play against a person (not a computer).
